						<h1>How to draw cards from an existing deck</h1>
						<p class="info">How to use the API to draw cards from an already created deck</p>
						<p>In our previous lesson, we learned how to <a href="createDeckAdvanced.html">create a deck with a function</a> and <a href="shuffle.html">shuffle the same deck with a custom function</a>. Please read these first if you have not already, then come back.
					</header>
					<p>We are well on our way to fully understanding the API. We now have a new deck, which came unshuffled, but we have shuffled it ourselves with our own JavaScript function. Shuffled decks are good, but what we really want to do is use cards from that shuffled deck, so let's learn how to draw cards from a deck!</p>
					<div class="image fit">
						<img src="images/draw.jpg">
					</div>
					<p>Notice that the only difference between this request and the <i>shuffle</i> request: <code>https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/deck_id/shuffle/</code> is <code>/shuffle/</code> becomes <code>/draw/?count=2</code>. You may recall when reading the <a href="json.html">JSON background information page</a> that everything after the <code>?</code> is the query string, and they come in key:value pairs.</p>
					<p>That is exactly what the API is requesting be provided in a 'Draw a Card' request. We must send it a key:value pair where the key is <code>count</code> and the value is of type <code>integer</code>, where the integer value can be any value representing the number of cards we would like to draw, so long as the deck has that many remaining. This is why we opt to save the full JSON response from the shuffle request in this <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/maxwell_ryan/gh18cwz0/10/">JSFiddle</a>. Doing so allows us to ensure we never draw more cards then the <code>deckData</code>'s <code>remaining</code> property. <strong>Attempting to draw more cards than those remaining is a <em>common mistake</em> with the API and can create bugs and potentially create runtime errors.</strong></p>
					<p>The response from drawing cards may look much more complex, but we can easily understand it by examining each piece.</p>
					<div class="image fit">
						<img src="images/drawResponse.jpg">
					</div>
					<p>The response returns in JSON, just like all of the other responses. The response includes a <code>success</code>, <code>deck_id</code>, and <code>remaining</code> property, just like all previous responses. The only difference is the exclusion of the<code>shuffled</code> property and the inclusion of the <code>cards</code> property.</p><br \>
					<p>The <code>cards</code> property is an array of objects, with each element in the array representing one drawn card. In the above images, <code>2</code> cards are requested, so the cards array contains 2 objects. Each card object possess a <code>image</code>, <code>value</code>, <code>suit</code>, and <code>code</code> property. Those properties describe the card(s) being drawn as follows:
						<ol>
							<li><code>image</code>The API replies with a URL to an image of the card drawn, this allows us to display the card rather than describe it via text.
							<li><code>value</code>The value of the card encoded as a string.
							<li><code>suit</code>The suit of the card encoded as a string.
							<li><code>code</code>The alphanumeric abbreviation of the card's value and suit, also encoded as a string.
						</ol>
					<p>Knowing all of this, let's draw some cards from the deck we previously created, then shuffled.
					<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="//jsfiddle.net/maxwell_ryan/3qaqc165/15/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
					<p>Here we create a <code>drawCards</code> method which behaves very similarly to the <code>createDeck</code> and <code>shuffleDeck</code> methods we previously wrote. You should be familiar and comfortable with the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> request procedure, as it is unchange. We also dynamically append <code>apiURL</code> with the number of cards we want to draw by passing an argument via the <code>numCards</code></p>
					<p>We also pass the deck we would like to draw from via the <code>deckObj</code> parameter. This can be any deck object which contains the <code>.deck_id</code> property as that value is also appended to the <code>apiURL</code> so the API knows which deck we would like to draw from.</p>
					<p>Note that we pass <code>deckData</code> as our argument, as it possess the <code>deck_id</code> property from our previous <code>shuffleDeck</code> call. Also note that we effectively refresh our <code>deckData</code> variable with new information by setting it to the return of our <code>drawCards</code> call. Let's examine this call's return data more closely through this object.<br \>
					<p>As the buttons on the results tab help illustrate, <code>deckData</code> now reflects that our deck has <code>51</code> cards <code>remaining</code>, but most importantly, that <code>cards</code> is an object. As mentioned above, that object contains our drawn cards information.</p>
					<p>By pressing the second button on the results tab, we can see all properties of the card that was drawn. Such as the below where I drew a 3 of Clubs <i>(not my lucky day)</i>:<br \></p>
					<img src="images/drawResults.jpg">
					<br \><p>To access a card's properties, you must navigate to the response's <code>cards</code> property and then utilize standard JavaScript array element access notation. If you don't know anything about this, please see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array">this</a>.</p>
					<p>In our case, <code>deckData.cards[0]</code> will access the card drawn, if an integer value more than 1 is passed to <code>drawCards</code>, then <code>deckData.cards[0]</code> would simply access the first card, <code>deckData.cards[1]</code> the second, and so forth. <strong>A word of caution, be careful with accessing the array elements, as this is a common error that can be made. <code>deckData.cards[0]</code> will always be the first card drawn; do not use <code>deckData.cards[1]</code> accidentally. Likewise, using our <code>drawCards</code> example, <code>deckData.cards[(numCards - 1)]</code> will always be the last card drawn, where <code>numCards</code> is the argument passed to <code>drawCards</code>.</strong></p>
					<p>Take a few moments and explore the following code, which simply calls the same <code>drawCards</code> method, but passes 4 instead of 1. All 4 of these cards are displayed.</p>

					<p>Lastly, you may have wondered what we can do with each card's <code>image</code> property. This were the value of the API really starts to show. We can actually ammend that image to a pre-existing <code>&ltimg&gt</code> tag and show the card drawn, rather than reading boring text. We can do it just like this:<br \></p>
					<p><code>document.getElementById("imgTagIdNameHere").src=deckData.cards[0].image</code> This will get our image tag and set its source to the first card we drew. We can also set up four image tags and assign them each to card <code>cards[0] - cards[3]</code> that we drew, just like this:</p><br \>
					<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="//jsfiddle.net/maxwell_ryan/0js6Lbpp/6/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
					<p><strong>You have now created a deck, shuffled it, and drawn the exact number of cards you want from it. There aren't many more activities in a card game, besides the rules themselves. But sometimes you need to discard cards you have drawn, so let's <a href="discard.html"> learn how to do that.</a></strong></p>

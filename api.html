						<h1>Application Program Interface (API)</h1>
						<p> An overview</p>
					</header>
					<p>Application Program Interface. To a new developer, this may sound complex and confusing, but it does not need to be. Diffrent APIs can serve different purposes, but at their core, all APIs provide developers with a means to send, extract, and receive information.</p>
					<iframe class="iframe fit" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s7wmiS2mSXY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>This video helps illustrate the point that APIs may sound extremely complex, but really, they simply help facilitate the exchange of information. In our case, this will be the exchange of playing card information from us, the developer, to the Deck of Cards server. The Deck of Cards API allows users of the API to simulate a deck of cards, this includes creating a new deck, drawing from a deck, placing cards in piles, and even reshuffling the deck we created.</p>
					<p>This all may sound good to you, but you may be asking, <i>why do we even need an API?</i> Great question. We want to create an application that involves the use of a card deck, but to do so, we would also need to develop methods that simulate a card deck. Our application just became much more complicated. Not only do we need to create the card game application itself, we also need to create an methods that simulates a deck of cards. Unless...someone has already done that for us. Lucky us, they have, and its called <a href="https:://deckofcardsapi.com">Deck of Cards API</a>.</p>
					<p>This is good, so our problem is simplified again. We can just create our application, and use the deck of card methods someone has already created; we don't need to 'reinvent the wheel'. So let's get started with our application. Oh, wait? How do we use the deck of cards methods already written for us? I guess we will need to look at the source code and encorporate that code into our specific game application.</p>
					<p>Actually, no. This is where the API comes in. Perhaps the API developer would rather not share his/her source code. In fact, we don't really need to know how the methods were implemented, just that they work and return the information we need! For the C/C++ programmer, this is much like a header file. You only need to know that the method exists, what information it takes (parameters), and what information it returns.</p>
					<p>Perhaps we want to draw two cards from a new 52 card deck. We send information using the exact format the API is expecting, the server then uses that information as parameters in its methods and then returns information in the exact format the API specifies it will. We then read this information and do with it as we please for our specific application. In this example, information describing the two cards we drew is returned. For this return information to be useful, we must be able to read it. The information is returned in JSON format. <a href="json.html">Read how to interpret that format</a>.</p>
